This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## 🎨 Color Palette & Design Rationale

This portfolio website is designed for Ivy League college applications.  
The goal is to maintain a **clean, professional, and academic** look that puts the focus on the student's work — not flashy design.

---

### 1. **Background Colors**
- **Primary:** `#FFFFFF` (White) → Maximum readability, professional look.
- **Secondary:** `#F9FAFB` (Gray-50) → Used for alternating sections to create subtle separation without harsh contrast.

---

### 2. **Headings (H1/H2)**
- **Color:** `#111827` (Gray-900)
- **Reason:** Very dark gray is easier on the eyes than pure black and maintains a formal, academic tone.

---

### 3. **Accent Color**
- **Color:** `#4F46E5` (Indigo-600)
- **Reason:** Represents trust, intelligence, and professionalism — often used in higher education branding.
- **Usage:** Link hover states, section highlights, icons.

---

### 4. **Button Colors**
- **Primary:** `#4F46E5` (Indigo-600)
- **Hover:** `#4338CA` (Indigo-700)
- **Text:** `#FFFFFF` (White)
- **Reason:** High-contrast and matches the brand accent while standing out as a clear call-to-action.

---

### 5. **Body Text**
- **Color:** `#374151` (Gray-700)
- **Reason:** Softer than black, making long reading sessions more comfortable.

---

### 6. **Design Principles Followed**
1. **Minimalism:** Avoided overly bright colors and heavy animations.
2. **Consistency:** Indigo is the single accent color used throughout for branding.
3. **Accessibility:** High contrast between text and background for readability.
4. **Professionalism:** Clean typography and subtle color variations reflect an academic tone.

---

### 🎯 Final Visual Concept
- **Navbar:** White background, dark gray text, indigo hover.
- **Headings:** Dark gray (`gray-900`).
- **Body Text:** Medium gray (`gray-700`).
- **Buttons:** Indigo background, white text, indigo hover darker.
- **Sections:** Alternate between white and light gray backgrounds.
